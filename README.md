# shiny-cluster-genotypes

`shiny-cluster-genotypes` is an R Shiny app to cluster samples based on their genotype data across a set of markers. It creates and displays MDS, tree, and tile plots.

Both a [functional version](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/apps/cluster-genotype-data/) of the app and [sample data files](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/apps/cluster-genotype-data/) are available. One sample file is tab-delimited and the other is comma-separated. In the file named `sample-data.snps.txt`, both `N` and `U` represent `NA` values. Therefore, enter the following into the field for NA strings: `N,U`.
